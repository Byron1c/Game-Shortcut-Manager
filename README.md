<p>Currently there is no way of adding these links to the Start Menu and Taskbar, while still launching via the correct platform. This means that Overlays, tracking of Play Time, and other information is not available to the game's platform. Launching the game or application via the EXE file will not do this. This is where <strong>Game Shortcut Manager</strong> comes in.</p> <p>This tool is designed to to let you put <strong>standard URLs, Steam, Epic, UPlay, and Twitch URLs</strong> on the Windows Start Menu, and Task Bar.</p>
