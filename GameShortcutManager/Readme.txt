The way it works....
1. Game Shortcut Manager will create shortcuts, and store them in any folder you set (though it's reccommended that you store them in one location for ease of reference)
2. You can also immediately assign them to the Start Menu and/or the Taskbar on saving
3. The shortcut will also be stored in a list, so it can be edited, recreated, etc as needed
4. You can use that list to also assign the shortcuts to the Start Menu, and Taskbar, or remove them
